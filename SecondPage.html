		It all starts to go downhill when Elliot gradually loses his self-control. He can go for days living as 
		Mr. Robot, and when he snaps out of it, he no longer remembers anything he did. His successful plan-which is 
		conducted in the end by Elliot or Mr. Robot?- has brought the world in an apocalyptic state and he is being 
		chased not only by one of the strongest people in the world, the Chinese minister of State Security who happens 
		to be the leader of a Chinese hacker group, but also by the FBI. This hacker group consists of extremely dangerous 
		people who kill whoever stands in their way, like they end up doing with Angela and Darlene’s boyfriend.

		It may look very fascinating witnessing what could possibly result by a single hacking act, even if it 
		is expressed excessively. Everything falls apart in a chain react. Still, this is not the actual message 
		this series is trying to send to us. It is much deeper, and it is very beautifully expressed by the perfect 
		cinematography that always manages to catch the character’s emotions, in order to highlight what Elliot and 
		the rest is really going through. Elliot’s struggle in isolation and his fight through depression. He starts to question 
		reality. Is he who he thinks he is? Is anything really happening? In the end 
		it becomes obvious that his Dissociative Identity Disorder goes from the childhood trauma he has experienced by his 
		parents, especially by his father’s abuse.

		In the Mr. Robot series is starring Elliot, a security engineer by day, hacker by night, who works 
		at a huge technology company called E corp. He lives alone in his apartment, and it seems his only friend 
		is his childhood neighbor Angela, with whom he is secretly in love with. His life takes a turn when he meets 
		group of hackers who are willing to recruit him in their mission to expose the people responsible for the 
		corruption of the modern world. The rest of this series is going to circulate around this plan, and his moral

		In the meantime, two equally important characters are introduced to us, Mr. Robot 
		alongside Darlene, Elliotâ€™s sister who becomes his partner in crime. This is when it is realized
		that Elliot struggles with serious mental problems. That is because Mr. Robot does not 
		actually exist, but only in his mind. It is the figure of the father he lost years ago, and it 
		has become his second personality. It should be noted that Elliot, in order to overcome his severe
		depression, abuses drugs and prescriptions whilst at the same time he cannot help himself but 
		obsessively hack everyone that he knows while keeping a record of all their personal infromation.
